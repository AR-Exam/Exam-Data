Subject: Regarding declaration of End Semester Examination Reappear Results

Respected Sir

Please refer to your letter no. 43/M.A. dated: 05/01/2021 regarding declaration of End Semester Examination reappear results.

We are very well aware of the state of students and itsâ€™ possible impact on their career.

Please note that the provisional reappear result has been declared on 24/12/2020.
You must be aware about the students who could not fill examination form in time, due to lock-down and poor internet or other issues, including failure to pay dues. We received many such requests to accommodate such students, which authorities considered keeping in view of the pandemic situation. That created additional work for us, and as many of our staff members were also affected by COVID-19. However, our staff worked overtime to declare result at the earliest possible.

The End Semester Examination was held in four phases namely Phase-I (23.09.2020 to 09.10.2020), Phase-II (29.09.2020 to 05.10.2020), Phase-III (15.10.2020 to 11.11.2020), and Phase-IV (25.11.2020 to 08.12.2020). The reappear examination was ended in Phase-IV which lasts on 08.12.2020 and the provisional reappear result was declared on 24.12.2020 well within the time constraint.

We hope you understand the situation well.

Thanks and Regards
